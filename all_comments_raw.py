There are some interesting studies about what happens in a boardroom of decision makers when just one woman is added to a group of men.

    '"If greatness of purpose, smallness of means, and astonishing results are the three criteria of a human genius, who could dare compare any great man in history with Muhammad? The most famous men created arms, laws, and empires only. They founded, if anything at all, no more than material powers which often crumbled away before their eyes. This man moved not only armies, legislations, empires, peoples, dynasties, but millions of men in one-third of the then inhabited world; and more than that, he moved the altars, the gods, the religions, the ideas, the beliefs and the souls. "On the basis of a Book, every letter which has become law, he created a spiritual nationality which blend together peoples of every tongue and race. He has left the indelible characteristic of this Muslim nationality the hatred of false gods and the passion for the One and Immaterial God. This avenging patriotism against the profanation of Heaven formed the virtue of the followers of Muhammad; the conquest of one-third the earth to the dogma was his miracle; or rather it was not the miracle of man but that of reason. "The idea of the unity of God, proclaimed amidst the exhaustion of the fabulous theogonies, was in itself such a miracle that upon it\'s utterance from his lips it destroyed all the ancient temples of idols and set on fire one-third of the world. His life, his meditations, his heroic revelings against the superstitions of his country, and his boldness in defying the furies of idolatry, his firmness in enduring them for fifteen years in Mecca, his acceptance of the role of public scorn and almost of being a victim of his fellow countrymen... This dogma was twofold the unity of God and the immateriality of God: the former telling what God is, the latter telling what God is not; the one overthrowing false gods with the sword, the other starting an idea with words. "Philosopher, Orator, Apostle, Legislator, Conqueror of Ideas, Restorer of Rational beliefs.... The founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire that is Muhammad. As regards all standards by which human greatness may be measured, we may well ask, is there any man greater than he?"

    "It depends on the leadership. Some leaders use power to make people's lives better. Others want to dominate people because they feel entitled to. \nIt's a continuum and no one is perfect. Listening to people in open forum is good for everyone. Knowing that people wielding power are fallible is just as important.\nCorruption will never go away. It is everyone's job to stamp it out at every turn and destroy those who would breach the public trust.\n\nExample time: Huge swaths of the legacy media up until pretty recently have wielded enormous power and still do but only in certain demographics. They wielded it irresponsibly to promote an agenda no sane person would want. Not overtly, but subtly. Now that their rags and chans are in the tank they're re-thinking their life choices. Forcing the powerful to lose power is the worst thing they could imagine, yet it has happened and will continue to should they try and beg and steal to convince you that everything they say is the truth.

    "Cool Women ,  I like that she is / was pretty it would seem and aged naturally . Its obvious she was probably quite attractive as a kid / young women and still is , when she smiles you can see the 20-30 year old women, but doesnt look all wierd and rubber faced . shiny and un natural . Considering she is / was a CEO of IBM and not a person who made money looking nice she looks great as an adult . Whatever she has or hasnt done as a person who has eyes on them it wasnt overboard and her visage doesnt make me uncomfortable with the un canny look that Plastic surgery causes my brain to get distracted and she has a young vibe  . Maybe its because she is a serious person and not just all ego , has real things she has done and lived , doesnt need to want to look like she is 30 as well as married forever and seems to respect her old man . Very cute when she laughs and smiles . GREAT REPRESENTATION of what good the feminist movement achieved and a good role model . She seems LEGIT HAPPY with no detectable animosity towards the world as a women , and Im sure she DID deal with some shit being a women running such a big legacy corp and perhaps judged differently but its obvious she is a bad mama jama and obvious leader in her personality as well as the humble self confidence .  Based on this interview which is my only reference I like her and I could see her being a good boss and leader I would work hard for and trust as a general. Compared to soo many CEOs she is less creepy . She isnt like Bill Gates who just has a creepy odd vibe about him and she seems more REAL then so many male CEOs who talk with affect . She seems like a person that would be a good hang and fun .",

Wanna replicate or move the database to a more scalable model? No. We won't let you. \n\nShe can say what she wants, but while she doesn't view it that way, almost no newer company is going to invest into using IBM it services or technology.",

It was fantastic to hear the inside view of the challenges she faced while running & changing IBM.  She is a remarkable person to have got to where she did in a very competitive, male dominated industry and a complex company culture. I am going to try and coax my 13 year old daughter to listen to some of this podcast. "aptitude <> access" is a powerful statement and also very true.

    'I don\'t think there is such a thing as good power, here\'s why:\nPower as a quantity describes to me the potential to affect directed change.\nEvery individual has some power, and the reason I don\'t believe in good power is that the distribution of this power in a group, if not mostly flat("everybody has the same power"), is not justifiable as the driver behind decisions because a group decision will always be better suited. Some hierarchies are definitely needed, but putting the word "good" in front of "power" when talking about managing people is really a misnomer to me, or at least implies something wrong, since you will always have a group that will always make a better decision than an individual, especially if that decision is about that group.',

IBM did not give its technical staff pay rises for DECADES and has completely neglected its mainframe staff, to the point now where there are enormous skill gaps in the workforce which will inevitably kill the mainframe. I hope you're reading this, Ginni. Take your massive, undeserved million dollar bonus and go fuck yourself with it you uptight, un-empathetic cunt.",

As a manager, I never ran into Ginni but I was in the software division when it could fit in a football field (in Boulder Co). I started out writing about tape machines, and even the tape. That all moved to Japan, and I got to work on IBM Pcs, robots that made PCs, ATMs and a myriad of other cool jobs. So I loved how IBM had a family culture of yes, things change children, but come with ur parents and u will be ok, with great retirement benefits and stable stock. Still, Ginni went up the ranks while I was, and she really sounds like the 90's line of thinking that was just developing , or taking hold within all management. But honestly, in the Watson and other hay days, upper management was really a sugar-coated industrial mogal from the turn of the century. You may be family, but u may have opportunities within the company to move around, and actually have fun (I did), but the expierance was more militaristic than you might think. No one talked politics or religion at work, and those that did (andrefused to leave) were stuck in a tiny lab in the corner of the raised floor. The same for any sexist or other otherwise obnoxious worker. We would never fire folks, just move them on, just like they do with soldiers in the army. But I look back now 30 plus years later with fond memories... don't dwell on the low salaries or hitting all depressions from the 70s to 2008. \nI made it, and it wasn't all bad... lots of my worktime was fun... hell, I met one of my wives there, she was an IBM engineer... also one of the few back then.",

During that period we were told it was to assist with the work load we we\'re expecting to see with her changes.   You guessed it.

    "@Xepa777 you gotta recognize that IBM was in a veritable nosedive and needed to refocus on things they had a shot at executing well, without becoming commoditized.  AWS, GCP and even Azure were ahead of IBM and are already plateauing in terms of feature-for-price for 80% of what customers demand, so what would a 4th entrant into PaaS distinctly offer?  Mainframes on cloud could have been an angle, leveraging their expertise there, but FinServs with mainframes can't easily move core data off prem when everything else is still co-located in private data centers.  And Watson - yea it was a solution looking for problems and they missed the GPT angle, but with fewer commodity consumer and cloud distractions, I wouldn't count them out of highly vertical industry-tailored Watson(+GPT) solutions just yet.  You can't move a 350k employee company overnight, or even over a decade without considerable retrenching.",
